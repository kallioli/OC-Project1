### Validated Project :white_check_mark:
https://webagency.kevinallioli.com/

You have just been hired by a web agency, the WebAgency, which creates websites for various clients.
However, they themselves recognize that their current site is aging because they have little time to work on it.
Of course, it seems that shoemakers have the worst shoes, but still...

So, for your first mission, we propose you to take care of the redesign of the agency's website.

The site must fit on a page with a menu that remains visible, at the top of the page, even when you move around the page.
The different sections expected are :

* A first welcome screen, very visual
* The list of services offered by the agency
* Examples of projects already completed
* A card with a contact form (we don't ask you to run the form, just to display it).

### Evaluation referential

**Define the content of a web page from a mock-up**

* All the content defined by the model is present
* Text content is relevant and grammatically correct
* The visual appearance corresponds to the computer screen model.
* The model is adapted in a relevant way on a mobile terminal.

**Coding the structure of a web page in HTML**

* HTML page passes w3c HTML validation without error
* HTML tags are defined with the relevant HTML 5 semantics
* The icons are created with a relevant tool, such as font-awesome.

**Coding the presentation of a web page in CSS**

* CSS code passes w3c CSS validation
* The CSS code is written in one or more CSS files.
* No CSS code is applied via a style attribute in an HTML tag.
* The area with the menu remains visible, at the top of the page, even when you move around the page.

**Manage responsiveness with Media Queries**

* The viewport is configured in the header of the HTML page.
* (At least) A relevant breakpoint is defined
* CSS @Media rules and/or dedicated style sheets identified by a media attribute are used.
* No Framework (Bootstrap type) is used for this project.
